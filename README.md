## 💘 Will You Be My Valentine? 💘
A fun, interactive, and romantic website to ask your special someone to be your Valentine! This project features a playful "Yes" and "No" button, where the "No" button tries to escape when hovered over, and the "Yes" button triggers a heartwarming celebration with confetti, a cute GIF, and a heartfelt message.

## 🌟 Features
* Interactive Buttons:

  * Click "Yes" to reveal a romantic message and a cute GIF.

  * The "No" button moves around the screen when you try to click it—because saying no isn’t an option! 😉

* Romantic Confetti:

  * When "Yes" is clicked, colorful confetti rains down to celebrate the moment.

* Cute Animations:

  * The GIF floats gently up and down for a magical touch.

  * Smooth fade-in and slide-in animations for text and buttons.
